## Overview

This project is about detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains transactions that are either legitimate or fraudulent. The goal is to create a model that can correctly identify fraud.

## Project Files

- `data/` - Contains the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It includes features like transaction time, amount, and anonymized data, with labels showing if a transaction is fraud or not.

## How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: 
   - Clean the data and scale it for better model performance.
   - Balance the data since there are fewer fraud cases.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualize the data to understand the patterns between fraud and non-fraud transactions.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train a model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Measure the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
